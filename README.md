# EscolaApp

Project made as a school project. Very basic, no authentication method, which is a thing I'd like to do in the future.

## What's it for?

This web application's main use is to simulate a simple, dark-mode, application to manage a school, with it's students, areas, courses, classes and subjects.

## Notes

This was by far my first "real" experience with code, and despite not being my cup of tea, I actually enjoyed it

If you analyze the code, you'll probably see my "small" evolution, which was the funniest part of this project

## Technologies

.NET Framework

## How to run

Run the database script on Microsoft SQL Management Server Studio and create the necessary connection on Visual Studio
